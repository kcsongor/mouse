# Global Mouse Events

Experimental package extending the mouse API with additional events, such as:

  - Handling right and middle buttons (probably want to disable the context menu,
      which is outside of the scope of this package for now)
  - Scroll events
  - Detecting if ctrl was pressed during the event
